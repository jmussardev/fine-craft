And that's our tall story for our humble key pocket.</br></br> </br></br>• Measures 11.5 x 5.6 cm ( 4.5” x 2.2”)</br>• Dimension of key in photo: 7 x 3 cm (2.7” x 1.2”)\"</br></br></br><h2>WHAT SETS IT APART</h2></br>The slightly unusual format fits even the longest of keys. We are especially keen on this prolonged format which makes it a rather special showpiece. Made from vegetable-tanned leather in Italy."
